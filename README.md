# RiskFlowNet: Intelligent Financial Risk Identification and Early Warning

This repository contains the code and resources for the project **"Intelligent Identification and Early Warning Model for Corporate Financial Risk Based on Deep Learning"**, which proposes a novel methodological framework integrating deep learning and structured dynamic modeling for enhanced corporate financial risk analysis.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of computational finance, understanding and managing corporate financial risk has become increasingly complex. Traditional econometric models struggle to capture:

- Temporal dependencies
- Systemic interconnections
- Sector-specific co-movements
- Non-stationary behaviors in financial data

To address these challenges, we introduce **RiskFlowNet**, a deep learning-based model that integrates:

- **Generative latent factor modeling**
- **Kronecker-based recurrent matrix factorization**
- **Cross-sector embedding**
- **Adaptive early warning systems**

##  Key Features

- **Structured dynamic modeling** for financial risk identification
- **Temporal memory and systemic risk capture**
- **Domain-specific embedding strategies**
- **Adaptability to economic regime shifts and capital flow volatility**
- Robust against parameter sensitivity and non-stationary financial signals

## Experimental Results

Empirical validation on high-dimensional corporate networks demonstrates:

- Improved early risk identification performance
- Enhanced robustness across varying market regimes
- Greater adaptability compared to traditional econometric models
